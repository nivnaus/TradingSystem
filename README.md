# Trading System
The trading system facilitates transactions between sellers and buyers through a platform consisting of various stores with product inventories. Users can take on roles as sellers, buyers, or administrators, managing stores, setting purchase and discount policies, and appointing additional managers. The system also integrates with external services for payment processing and product delivery, while providing real-time notifications and maintaining security and usability to protect user data and ensure a seamless user experience.
